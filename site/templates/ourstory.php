Finally, we generate jobs by employing from within the community - offering much needed legal work that promotes social inclusion. </p>

          <p>This is a project about people, food and building community and lasting opportunity for vulnerable persons (refugees, migrants, homeless) in Athens, who face a number of challenges as they go about making their lives. Food not only nourishes - it welcomes and dignifies. Food is about love, comfort and hospitality. There is a kindness in the practice of preparing food, a wish that you will be well, healthy and replete, as well as warm and safe. </p>

          <h2 class='text-lg mb-2'>Why we are more than just a free meal</h2>
          
          <p>We empower displaced persons with cooking skills that can kickstart prosperous much-needed careers. Learning to cook is hospitable and collective, it comes with conversation and togetherness, it is the bond of family and friendship and the connection to community and culture. Weâ€™re here to look after each other, using food as the tool kit.</p>
