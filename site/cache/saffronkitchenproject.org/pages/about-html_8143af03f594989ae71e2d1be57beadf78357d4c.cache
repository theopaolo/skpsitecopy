Collaboration is the cornerstone of any good initiative, for this reason, in order to make SKP as successful as we can be, we will collaborate with other organisations based in Athens, allowing us to have the greatest reach possible.<\/p>\r\n                <p>Meet the team\u2026<\/p>\r\n\r\n            <\/section>\r\n            <section class=\"span-3-11 lg-span-2-12 xs-span-1-13 team-members\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"text-bg mb-2\">SKP Team<\/h2>\r\n                                    <article class=\"team-member\">\r\n                        <div class=\"profile\">\r\n                                                            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/saffronkitchenproject.org\/media\/pages\/about\/ba255f4396-1637318050\/evelina.jpg\">                                                    <\/div>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div> \r\n                            <h3 class=\"m-0\">Evelina Eskenazi<\/h3>\r\n                            <p>Founder & Director<\/p>\r\n                            <p>Evelina's six years in the food industry, working and training in restaurants and ultimately setting up her own catering company, helped her to recognise the importance of food and the joy it can bring to people. She spent the following five years working in humanitarian aid, running a warehouse in a refugee camp and setting up as well as managing an education and community centre. This helped refine her aptitude in working with vulnerable people and running teams of staff and volunteers. All of this experience has equipped her with the necessary skills to start Saffron Kitchen Project, whose goal is to provide both opportunity, and a sense of community, for refugees and vulnerable people.<\/p>\n<p>Her favourite meal is pasta cooked by someone else (obviously by someone who can cook pasta).<\/p> \r\n                        <\/div>\r\n                    <\/article>\r\n                                    <article class=\"team-member\">\r\n                        <div class=\"profile\">\r\n                                                            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/saffronkitchenproject.org\/media\/pages\/about\/e4a03f2c62-1642691712\/received_1007416033536560.jpeg\">                                                    <\/div>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div> \r\n                            <h3 class=\"m-0\">Konstantina Karakatsani<\/h3>\r\n                            <p>Project Coordinator <\/p>\r\n                            <p>Konstantina has an educational background in psychology. Since 2016 she has been working at the Child Protection sector of Humanitarian Aid providing support to refugee children and families. As a coordinator of psychoeducational programs she always aimed to enhance the resilience and the life skills both of the minors and the field workers. She believes in the importance of safe space and recreational activity for healing after trauma experiences, and food can provide that comfort. From our Day 1 we learn that food is care, and care is what we need when being in a difficult situation. We can either focus on what we have in front of us at here and now (basic rules of mindfulness) or let it guide us to the memories that eating it brings up. Apart from providing us with energy, food can warm our hearts and bring people together. That\u2019s why she decided to join the SKP team!<\/p>\n<p>Konstantina enjoys cooking after a hard day as it makes her relax and nurse herself. Her comfort food is pasta, but she will rarely say no to a souvlaki!<\/p> \r\n                        <\/div>\r\n                    <\/article>\r\n                                    <article class=\"team-member\">\r\n                        <div class=\"profile\">\r\n                                                            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/saffronkitchenproject.org\/media\/pages\/about\/67f77da051-1649944540\/img_5858.jpg\">                                                    <\/div>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div> \r\n                            <h3 class=\"m-0\">Adel Boshi<\/h3>\r\n                            <p>Chef<\/p>\r\n                            <p>As a young boy growing up in Damascus, Syria, Adel would try to cook with his mother, but she usually kicked him out of the kitchen because he was too messy.

In 2011, Adel left Syria for Egypt, where he continued working in restaurants. He came to Europe in 2015 and volunteered with the NGO Meet \u2019n Eat in Berlin.

He feels proud to be part of the SKP team, doing something that gives him not only joy but also professional experience. While working here he continues to provide support in Uganda, and is currently fulfilling his dream of building a home for street children and orphans in Kampala.<\/p>\n<p>Kimuli believes food should be nutritious and provide energy, and his favourite meal is vegetables with rice.<\/p> \r\n                        <\/div>\r\n                    <\/article>\r\n                                    <article class=\"team-member\">\r\n                        <div class=\"profile\">\r\n                                                            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/saffronkitchenproject.org\/media\/pages\/about\/a629b8b811-1649946681\/img_5860.jpg\">                                                    <\/div>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div> \r\n                            <h3 class=\"m-0\">Aadel Mirzazada<\/h3>\r\n                            <p>Kitchen Assistant<\/p>\r\n                            <p>Aadel\u2019s goal of becoming a doctor was interrupted in 2015, when he left his university studies in Afghanistan and fled to Turkey.
